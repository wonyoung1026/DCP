# Decentralized Cloud Platform

With the great drop of the prices of cryptocurrencies, a large amount of computation
power previously used for mining is released. A decentralized cloud platform can be
built to utilize these computation power distributed geographically and owned by
individuals to provide cloud services. This project
aims at building such a system to enable the owners to sell computing power online,
and allow users to enjoy cloud services at a price lower than giant cloud providers.
